# Tickity-tac-toe
A simple twist on a simple game that makes it significantly less simple :)

In this version, you're actually playing 10 games of tic-tac-toe simultaneously.

## Rules

* Each turn, a player takes on empty space in one of the mini-boards
* Winning a mini-board, wins that space on the game board
* The player who gets three-in-a-row on the game board wins
* **twist** players do not get to pick which of the 9 mini-boards they play on. Rather this is determined by their opponent's previous move. Whichever space they choose on the mini-board, that becomes the next space that is played on the game board.

## Special Rules

* If a mini-board results in a tie, that space cannot be used by either player to win the game.
* Alternatively, a tie on the mini-board could be used by both players.

## NOTES

* This is a work in progress (WIP)
* Known issues
    * No UI
    * Not yet scoring the big board
